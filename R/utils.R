## TODO: a programmatic version tidyDataFrame, that takes a vector of
## the form c(fvar = "d", ....) and probably one that drops all List
## columns.
##
## This begs the question whether it is necessary at all to have the
## reduced versions, as one should be able to return to the source
## FeatureSet, that contains all the feature variables.
##
## It might be useful to define some session-wide default rules?
